def save_model(model: Any, target: str, output_dir: str):
    """
    Given a model and target label, save the model file in the output_directory.

    The specific format depends on your implementation.

    Common Deep Learning Model File Formats are:

        SavedModel (TensorFlow)
        Pros: Framework-agnostic format, can be deployed in various environments. Contains a complete model representation.
        Cons: Can be somewhat larger in file size.

        HDF5 (.h5) (Keras)
        Pros: Hierarchical structure, good for storing model architecture and weights. Common in Keras.
        Cons: Primarily tied to the Keras/TensorFlow ecosystem.

        ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)
        Pros: Framework-agnostic format aimed at improving model portability.
        Cons: May not support all operations for every framework.

        Pickle (.pkl) (Python)
        Pros: Easy to save and load Python objects (including models).
        Cons: Less portable across languages and environments. Potential security concerns.

    IMPORTANT: Add additional arguments as needed. We have just given the model as an argument, but you might have
    multiple files that you save.

    :param model: the model that you want to save.
    :param target: the target value - can be useful to name the model file for the target it is intended for
    :param output_dir: the output directory to same one or more model files.
