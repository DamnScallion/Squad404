Is Epic Intro Dataset
---------------------

IMPORTANT: The following dataset is part of Berrijam Jam 2024 and released for use by participants of the Berrijam Jam 2024. Use outside of the competition requires permission from Berrijam which can be obtained by emailing jam@berrijam.com. 

The folder contains three types of files:
1. PNG files are spectrogram of the first 30 seconds of audio from the corresponding MP3 file. 
2. MP3 files which are provided only as a reference, and should not be directly used in your code. They are provided as a way to help understand the spectogram images. 
3. Labels-IsEpicIntro-2024-03-25.csv contains the labels for the corresponding png file.

Your solution should be able to predict if a song will be considered epic or not based only on the spectogram image file. You DO NOT have to generate the spectogram image from mp3. 

Each image file is 1200 x 900 pixel.
